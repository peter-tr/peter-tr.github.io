As a part of a design course, I enrolled in, we were required to develop a website with the theme of holidays. I created the website using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learnt a lot about UX design and HCI (human computer interactions) from this course and I am very proud of the website I created in the end. The website features multiple webpages and all the images used were either self-created or royalty-free. Other than form validation and a simple quiz, no backend process was considered as the onus of the course was on design. 
Please refer to the design portfolio for the process.
